# Course Creation Application

This project consists of a backend and frontend that need to be run separately.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.

### Running the Backend

1. Open a new terminal in VS Code.
2. Navigate to the backend directory: cd backend
3. Start the backend server: npm run dev
 4. Keep this terminal open and running.

### Running the Frontend

1. Open a new terminal in VS Code (without closing the backend terminal).
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:cd frontend
3. Start the frontend development server: npm run dev

The application should now be running. Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by the frontend development server (typically `http://localhost:5173` or similar).

## Note

Ensure that both the backend and frontend servers are running simultaneously for the application to function correctly.
